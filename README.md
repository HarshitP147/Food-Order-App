# Greetings!!

This is the repository for the Simple Food ordering app. Here you can order only 6 food Indian dishes and a sweet. The cart and is updated automatically as you increase or decrease the food items.

Clone the repository and run `npm run dev` after installing the dependencies.

Type `npm run build` for build version of this app.

This page is made using TailwindCSS ,React js and TypeScript is not fully responsive.

For contributions, maek a seperate branch and add a pull request.

This app can also be a potential idea for a full stack food ordering app like Zomato or Uber Eats!!

### Thank you!
